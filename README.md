# Custom Safari Package Booking System

This project aims to enhance the user experience by providing a seamless and interactive booking system for custom safari packages. Our goal is to simplify the process of selecting and customizing safari packages according to the user's preferences. Upon submission of their preferences, users will be assigned a dedicated agent.
